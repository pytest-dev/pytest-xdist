How-tos
-------

This section show cases how to accomplish some specialized tasks with ``pytest-xdist``.

Identifying the worker process during a test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*New in version 1.15.*

If you need to determine the identity of a worker process in
a test or fixture, you may use the ``worker_id`` fixture to do so:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture()
    def user_account(worker_id):
        """use a different account in each xdist worker"""
        return "account_%s" % worker_id

When ``xdist`` is disabled (running with ``-n0`` for example), then
``worker_id`` will return ``"master"``.

Worker processes also have the following environment variables
defined:

.. envvar:: PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER

The name of the worker, e.g., ``"gw2"``.

.. envvar:: PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER_COUNT

The total number of workers in this session, e.g., ``"4"`` when ``-n 4`` is given in the command-line.

The information about the worker_id in a test is stored in the ``TestReport`` as
well, under the ``worker_id`` attribute.

Since version 2.0, the following functions are also available in the ``xdist`` module:


.. autofunction:: xdist.is_xdist_worker
.. autofunction:: xdist.is_xdist_controller
.. autofunction:: xdist.is_xdist_master
.. autofunction:: xdist.get_xdist_worker_id

Identifying workers from the system environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*New in version 2.4*

If the `setproctitle`_ package is installed, ``pytest-xdist`` will use it to
update the process title (command line) on its workers to show their current
state.  The titles used are ``[pytest-xdist running] file.py/node::id`` and
``[pytest-xdist idle]``, visible in standard tools like ``ps`` and ``top`` on
Linux, Mac OS X and BSD systems.  For Windows, please follow `setproctitle`_'s
pointer regarding the Process Explorer tool.

This is intended purely as an UX enhancement, e.g. to track down issues with
long-running or CPU intensive tests.  Errors in changing the title are ignored
silently.  Please try not to rely on the title format or title changes in
external scripts.

Uniquely identifying the current test run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*New in version 1.32.*

If you need to globally distinguish one test run from others in your
workers, you can use the ``testrun_uid`` fixture. For instance, let's say you
wanted to create a separate database for each test run:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest
    from posix_ipc import Semaphore, O_CREAT


    @pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
    def create_unique_database(testrun_uid):
        """create a unique database for this particular test run"""
        database_url = f"psql://myapp-{testrun_uid}"

        with Semaphore(f"/{testrun_uid}-lock", flags=O_CREAT, initial_value=1):
            if not database_exists(database_url):
                create_database(database_url)


    @pytest.fixture()
    def db(testrun_uid):
        """retrieve unique database"""
        database_url = f"psql://myapp-{testrun_uid}"
        return database_get_instance(database_url)


Additionally, during a test run, the following environment variable is defined:

.. envvar:: PYTEST_XDIST_TESTRUNUID

The unique id of the test run.

Accessing ``sys.argv`` from the controller node in workers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To access the ``sys.argv`` passed to the command-line of the controller node, use
``request.config.workerinput["mainargv"]``.


Specifying test exec environments in an ini file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use pytest's ini file configuration to avoid typing common options.
You can for example make running with three subprocesses your default like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    addopts = -n3

You can also add default environments like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    addopts = --tx ssh=myhost//python=python3.9 --tx ssh=myhost//python=python3.6

and then just type::

    pytest --dist=each

to run tests in each of the environments.


Specifying "rsync" dirs in an ini-file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a ``tox.ini`` or ``setup.cfg`` file in your root project directory
you may specify directories to include or to exclude in synchronisation:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    rsyncdirs = . mypkg helperpkg
    rsyncignore = .hg

These directory specifications are relative to the directory
where the configuration file was found.

Making session-scoped fixtures execute only once
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``pytest-xdist`` is designed so that each worker process will perform its own collection and execute
a subset of all tests. This means that tests in different processes requesting a high-level
scoped fixture (for example ``session``) will execute the fixture code more than once, which
breaks expectations and might be undesired in certain situations.

While ``pytest-xdist`` does not have a builtin support for ensuring a session-scoped fixture is
executed exactly once, this can be achieved by using a lock file for inter-process communication.

The example below needs to execute the fixture ``session_data`` only once (because it is
resource intensive, or needs to execute only once to define configuration options, etc), so it makes
use of a `FileLock <https://pypi.org/project/filelock/>`_ to produce the fixture data only once
when the first process requests the fixture, while the other processes will then read
the data from a file.

Here is the code:

.. code-block:: python

    import json

    import pytest
    from filelock import FileLock


    @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
    def session_data(tmp_path_factory, worker_id):
        if worker_id == "master":
            # not executing in with multiple workers, just produce the data and let
            # pytest's fixture caching do its job
            return produce_expensive_data()

        # get the temp directory shared by all workers
        root_tmp_dir = tmp_path_factory.getbasetemp().parent

        fn = root_tmp_dir / "data.json"
        with FileLock(str(fn) + ".lock"):
            if fn.is_file():
                data = json.loads(fn.read_text())
            else:
                data = produce_expensive_data()
                fn.write_text(json.dumps(data))
        return data


The example above can also be use in cases a fixture needs to execute exactly once per test session, like
initializing a database service and populating initial tables.

This technique might not work for every case, but should be a starting point for many situations
where executing a high-scope fixture exactly once is important.


Creating one log file for each worker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create one log file for each worker with ``pytest-xdist``, you can leverage :envvar:`PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER`
to generate a unique filename for each worker.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py
    def pytest_configure(config):
        worker_id = os.environ.get("PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER")
        if worker_id is not None:
            log_file = config.getini("worker_log_file")
            logging.basicConfig(
                format=config.getini("log_file_format"),
                filename=f"tests_{worker_id}.log",
                level=config.getini("log_file_level"),
            )


When running the tests with ``-n3``, for example, three files will be created in the current directory:
``tests_gw0.log``, ``tests_gw1.log`` and ``tests_gw2.log``.
