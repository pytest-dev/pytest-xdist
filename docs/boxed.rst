.. _boxed:

Running tests in a boxed subprocess (moved to pytest-forked)
============================================================

This functionality has been moved to the
`pytest-forked <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-forked>`_ plugin, but the ``--boxed`` option
is still kept for backward compatibility.
