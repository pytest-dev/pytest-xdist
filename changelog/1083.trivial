Add ``--no-loadscope-reorder`` which only applies to ``dist=loadscope``. If passed in, this will not attempt to sort test scopes by number of tests and retain test scopes based on input ordering. Doing so guarantees that, given [input_1, input_2], input_2 will never run before input_1. On any given worker, input_2 will either run after input_1, or input_1 has never and will never run on this worker.
