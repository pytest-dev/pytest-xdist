Avoid remote calls during startup as ``execnet`` by default does not ensure remote affinity with the
main thread and might accidentally schedule the pytest worker into a non-main thread, which breaks numerous frameworks,
for example ``asyncio``, ``anyio``, ``PyQt/PySide``, etc.

A more safe correction will require thread affinity in ``execnet`` (`pytest-dev/execnet#96 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/execnet/issues/96>`__).
