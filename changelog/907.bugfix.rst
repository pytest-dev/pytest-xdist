Avoid remote calls during startup as execnet by default does not ensure remote affinity with the main thread and accidentially sheduling the pytest worker into a non main thread breaks numerous frameworks.
For example asyncio, anyio, pyqt/pyside.

A more safe correction will require thread affinity in execnet.
