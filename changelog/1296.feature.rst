``-n auto`` and ``-n logical`` now support the ``PYTHON_CPU_COUNT``
environment variable and the ``-X cpu_count`` option from Python 3.13 (but
on all supported Python versions) to override the auto-detected CPU count.
The ``PYTEST_XDIST_AUTO_NUM_WORKERS`` environment variable has precedence
over these.
